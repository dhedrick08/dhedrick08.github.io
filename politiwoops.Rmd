Politiwoops' interest is to allow the tweets to remain public even after the politician deletes the tweet. They could use the utilitarian ethical framework to defend their position of publicizing deleted tweets. They could make the argument that an unflitered view of a politician's thoughts and feelings on certain issues gives the greatest number of voters the best information to make a decision at the ballot box, and mitigates some of the risk of dishonesty from politicians.

Moreover, they could counter an expectation-of-privacy argument from a politician by arguing that a saving a deleted embarassing tweet would be no different than taking a photograph of an eventually-taken-down billboard advertisement that was also ill-advised. 

More information about the utilitarian approach and other ethical approaches is located at the link at the top of this page.
